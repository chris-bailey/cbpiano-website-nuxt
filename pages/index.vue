    <p>In this day and age it's difficult to remember to stop and smell the roses. When I feel like I'm losing touch with
      what's important, I sit down at the piano and I watch to see what happens. Everything that I'm feeling flows through
      me into the piano and music is created.</p>

    <p>While composing I am in a place without time or mind. If I allow myself to think too much then the whole process
      breaks down and the music stops. A balance must be found between the mind and the heart so that everything flows
      smoothly.</p>

    <p>I am very excited to be able to share the album titled <strong><em>I Will Always Remember</em></strong>. I started
      composing some of the songs when I was just 15 years old. Each and every song on this album is the culmination of
      years of work. Each and every song was created during an important event in my life that inspired the music.</p>

    <p>This album has been a labour of love. I composed, arranged, performed, produced, mixed and mastered every single
      song with the latest technology available at the time. It is one of the largest projects I have ever undertaken and
      I am pleased to be able to share it.</p>
    <br />

    <p>All of the songs on the album are available on <a
        href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-will-always-remember/435243973">iTunes</a> and <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/album/18mNvmkOHA1Ykxt5PXHqXz">Spotify</a>.</p>

    <p>So please take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the music!</p>
